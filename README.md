# ELK-Explorations

I did some experimenting with a container running an ELK stack as a learning experience. I used screen captures
to document what worked. My original intent was a tutorial series of blogs. Due to restructuring of our web 
page and other factors, these have been sitting unposted so far. They're also long for a blog.

They did serve their purpose in familiarization and getting some potentially useful results. Without a specific
customer / need, it's not clear where to take this to provide value to someone. 

In any case, here they are, in case they help you understand what an ELK stack can do, or help you start an ELK
related reporting project.
